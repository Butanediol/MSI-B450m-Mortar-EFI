## MSI-B450m-Mortar-EFI

~~Tested on macOS 11.6, theoretically support macOS Monterey.~~

~~Support macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur, macOS Monterey.~~

The latested tested version is [OC 0.8.0](https://github.com/Butanediol/MSI-B450m-Mortar-EFI/releases/tag/Tested).

I've got an Apple Silicon MacBook, so this configuration might not get updates frequently.

### My system

- Motherboard: MSI B450m Mortar
- CPU: Ryzen 5 2600
- Graphics: Radeon RX 590 (without GME)
- WiFi and Bluetooth: BCM943602 (natively supported in macOS Big Sur)
- Ethernet: RealtekRTL8111

### What's not working

- Front mic jack (use a usb adapter)
- You tell me

probably:

- DRM (Apple Music/TV works fine, Netflix or others idk)

There is a memory alert when startup, which doesn't hurt, but you have mutiple methods to dismiss that if you want.

1. By changing the SystemProductName to iMacPro1,1, which means you also have to re-generate a serial number.
2. By using [IOIIIO/MacProMemoryNotificationDisabler](https://github.com/IOIIIO/MacProMemoryNotificationDisabler)

### Attention

If you have a CPU other than mine, make sure to **edit kernal patch before trying booting** according to [AMD_Vanilla#read-me-first](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla#read-me-first).

TLDR: find `B8060000 0000/BA060000 0000/BA060000 0090` and replace them with `B8 <CoreCount> 0000 0000/BA <CoreCount> 0000 0000/BA <CoreCount> 0000 0090`. For the segment `<CoreCount>`  please check the table below.

| CoreCount | Hexadecimal|
|--------|---------|
|   4 Core  | `04` |
|   6 Core  | `06` |
|   8 Core  | `08` |
|   12 Core | `0C` |
|   16 Core | `10` |
|   24 Core | `18` |
|   32 Core | `20` |	

Please **do use a unique serial number** which can be generated by a lot of tools. Otherwise, continuity and iCloud won't work cuz the serial number and system product name does not match. 

If you run into any problem, feel free to contact me at 07runtime-tenses@icloud.com but I don't guarantee any solution or detailed infomation. (I'll try tho XD)

If you want configs of older opencore version(from 0.6.7 to 0.7.4), please also contact me.

### Special thanks

This configuration is upgraded and modified from heyxiaobai/MSI-B450m-MORTAR-Hackintosh, with newer OpenCore version and GUI boot picker.
